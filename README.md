xmpp_client_strophejs
=====================

Javascript Web XMPP Client...Works with Google Talk &amp; Facebook Chat, and Openfire for a custom server.
I Used Nginx &amp; Punjab as well.

To get the XMPP client running, first I installed Punjab, which requires python. 

For Punjab I used the version on github: https://github.com/twonds/punjab
-Note: for Punjab, you need python, and version 2.7 worked for me, but not version 3.3..
-Install instructions can be found on the github page.

For nginx, I used the windows pre-configured version: http://www.kevinworthington.com/nginx-for-windows/
-Other versions directly from the nginx page did not work for me...
